# Dijkstra's algorithm in Python

I was first introduced to this algorithm through routing protocols (OSPF). The algorithm also happens to be what powers navigation in our phones, as it simply finds the shotest path between any two connected nodes, such as your house and the nearest brewery.

This was my first time working with graphs and priority queues, but I wanted to give it a try, and this is what I came up with.

The example graph that I use comes from a video by Computerphile, which incidentally provides a great overview of the algorithm. Be sure to check it out: https://youtu.be/GazC3A4OQTE
